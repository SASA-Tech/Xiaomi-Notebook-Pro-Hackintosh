## NOTES:
There would be the NVIDIA GeForce MX150 / MX250 which, however, not being compatible with macOS is disabled for the latter.
Kexts updated to the latest versions.

## If you want to install the Beta 8 of macOS Monterey:
~~I leave you the config.plist renamed to configbeta8.plist ready to use ONLY to download and install the update.
At the end of the update you have to delete it and put back the original config.plist.
It is advisable to disconnect the Hackintosh from the Apple ID before temporarily replacing the config.plist, alternatively use the kexts RestrictEvents.~~

This update issue has been fixed with OpenCore 0.7.4.
Now you can update without RestrictEvents.kexts and without changing config.plist

# Bios Settings

## Disable:

- Fastboot
- Secure Boot

## Notes BIOS:
Having a simple BIOS may sound good but it's not at all.
Post installation I strongly suggest you to adjust the parameters related to DVMT Pre and Total, to fix the CFG Lock and to disable VT-d with the help of the ru.efi tool
Only after doing this, remove the AppleXcpmCfgLock and DisableIoMapper quirks, serve to have a smoother boot by removing unnecessary patches.
I found that in post installation, Fastboot can be enabled without causing any nuisance to OpenCore, actually speeding up the boot of the latter, albeit slightly.

# Post Install:

Delete config.plist by EFI > OC and rename post-install.plist to config.plist
